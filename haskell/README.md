Well typed implementation of ideas I wrote in black FB notebook.

Next steps:
1. Proof transformation v1
    Basic refl
2. Functions
    Multiple args
    Replace operators (plus, minus)
3. Property objects
    includes arrays
    Since data, as refed by iotas, not vars, is immutable, should all "properties" just be functions?
4. Improved proof representation, proof engine
    Proof engine would be able to apply generalized rewritings supplied by functions
5. Proof transformation v1
6. Test against motivating example cases (safe access to lize of size known at runtime, parallel iteration of lists, provably safe doubly linked list)
