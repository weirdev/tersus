Well typed implementation of ideas I wrote in black FB notebook.

Next steps:
1. Property objects
2. Functions
    Replace operators (plus, minus)
3. Improved proof representation, proof engine
    Proof engine would be able to apply generalized rewritings supplied by functions
3. Proof transformation
4. Test against motivating example cases (parallel iteration of lists, provably safe doubly linked list)
