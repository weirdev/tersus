A toy PL for writing proofs inline with imperative code.

The python/ dir contains some initial ideas on syntax.
The haskell/ dir contains the most recent work of proof rewriting.

If the project progresses to a semi-stable feature set and syntax,
the next step will be to look into replacing/integrating the proofing system with one of Lean, Prolog, etc.
Such an integration might yield benifits in correctness and/or autodeduction.
