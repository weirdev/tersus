# Tersus Language Guide

Tersus is a small imperative language for writing ordinary computations next to proof and validation statements. The current implementation supports integers, integer lists, user-defined functions, nested blocks, and a proof validator built around an internal proof engine for equality, simple rewrites, and builtin function contracts.

This guide describes the Haskell implementation in this package. Runnable programs that demonstrate the features below are in [`examples/`](examples/README.md).

## Program Shape

A program is a block of statements separated by semicolons. The final semicolon is optional, and repeated semicolons are accepted.

```tersus
x = [3, 6, 9, 12];
y = size(x);
affirm y = 4;
```

Whitespace can be spaces, tabs, or newlines. Identifiers must start with a letter and may contain letters and digits.

## Comments

`//` starts a comment that runs to the end of the line. Comments are treated as whitespace, so they can appear anywhere whitespace can, including inside contracts and lists.

```tersus
// Whole-line comment
x = 5; // trailing comment
```

There are no block comments.

## Values

Tersus currently has four runtime value categories:

- Integers: `0`, `1`, `42`
- Integer lists: `[]`, `[1]`, `[3, 6, 9]`
- Booleans: `true`, `false`
- Functions: builtin functions from the standard library or user-defined functions

Boolean values can also be produced by relation expressions such as `x < y`, but the language does not yet have control-flow constructs that consume them.

Negative literals are not parsed directly. Use subtraction instead, for example `0 - 1`.

## Expressions

Expressions can be literals, variables, function calls, parenthesized expressions, or infix operations.

```tersus
5
[1, 2, 3]
x
size(x)
first(xs) + last(xs)
(10 - 5) - 5
```

The current infix operators are:

- Arithmetic: `+`, `-`
- Relations: `=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`

All infix operators currently share one precedence level and associate left. Use parentheses when the intended grouping matters.

## Builtins

The standard library seeds these builtin functions:

- `size(list)`: returns the length of an integer list.
- `first(list)`: returns the first element of a non-empty integer list.
- `last(list)`: returns the last element of a non-empty integer list.
- `+` and `-`: integer arithmetic.
- `=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`: integer relations returning booleans.

`first` and `last` have builtin input contracts requiring the list size to be greater than zero. Their current validation proof relies on the standard-library `eqToGtZero` axiom, whose input contract is checked by the primitive `checkGtZero` rewrite. Concrete evaluation still rejects empty lists and wrong argument types.

## Statements

### Assignment

Assignments bind a variable in the current scope. If a variable already exists in the current or parent scope, assignment updates that existing binding.

```tersus
x = 5;
xs = [3, 6, 9];
n = size(xs);
```

### Return

`return` evaluates an expression and stores it as the return value for the top-level active block or function call.

```tersus
return size(xs);
```

### Blocks

Blocks introduce a nested statement queue and parent scope.

```tersus
x = [3, 6, 9];
{
    x = [1];
};
return size(x);
```

In the current implementation, assignment searches parent scopes before creating a new local binding. Reassigning `x` inside the nested block updates the outer `x` if it already exists.

### Functions

Functions are defined with `fn` and assigned to the given name.

```tersus
fn add1(i) {
    return i + 1;
};

x = add1(4);
```

Function arguments are comma-separated. Function bodies are ordinary statement blocks.

The evaluator runs a function body with its argument bindings and expects the body to set a return value. If a function completes without `return`, evaluation fails.

### Argument Passing

Arguments are passed by value. Each argument expression is evaluated before the call and bound to the matching parameter in a fresh scope. The caller's variable is not moved and is still usable afterwards, and nothing the function does to a parameter, including reassigning it, is visible to the caller.

```tersus
fn reset(xs) {
    xs = [];
    return size(xs);
};

xs = [1, 2, 3];
n = reset(xs);
return size(xs) - n; // 3, because the caller's xs is unchanged
```

A function body's scope has no parent scope, so assignments inside it never reach caller variables, unlike assignments in nested blocks. The number of arguments must match the number of parameters exactly, for both user-defined functions and builtins. A mismatch fails evaluation and validation.

During validation, arguments are symbolic values. Proofs the caller has established about an argument are visible to the callee's input contract, which is how a call such as `spread(x)` can rely on `size(x) > 0` proven at the call site.

## Validation Statements

Validation statements are ordinary statements syntactically, but they are used by the validator rather than by concrete evaluation. Concrete evaluation skips them.

### `affirm`

`affirm` requires a proof to be entailed by the current proof context. The proof may be present directly or match through known equality-equivalent terms.

```tersus
x = 5;
affirm x = 5;
```

Proofs use expression-like syntax. Variables refer to symbolic values tracked by the validator. Concrete values can appear directly.

```tersus
affirm size(xs) > 0;
affirm y = (x + 1);
```

### `define`

`define` introduces a proof variable by validating an expression and recording equality between the new proof variable and that expression.

```tersus
define s = size(xs);
affirm s > 0;
```

Proof variables are especially useful in function contracts, where they can be exported from input or output validation sections.

### `rewrite`

`rewrite` applies a named proof-engine rewrite rule or a user-defined axiom/proof rule.

```tersus
rewrite eqToGtZero s;
rewrite myRule x;
rewrite refl x = 5;
rewrite eval y;
rewrite evalAll;
```

Primitive rewrite rules:

- `rewrite refl <proof>`: uses known equalities to derive reflected/substituted proofs.
- `rewrite eval <var>`: evaluates builtin-function proofs related to a variable when concrete inputs are known.
- `rewrite evalAll`: attempts builtin evaluation for all available evaluable proofs.
- `rewrite checkGtZero <proof>`: validates and inserts `<proof> > 0` when that proof is already entailed or when the proof term has a concrete positive integer value.

The standard library also provides trusted axiom rules:

- `rewrite eqToLtPlus1 <proof>`: assumes the argument is less than itself plus one.
- `rewrite eqToGtZero <proof>`: exports the argument as greater than zero after its input contract validates through `checkGtZero`.

Unknown rule names parse as user rewrites and fail during validation if no matching rule has been defined.

## Axioms And Proof Rules

User-defined rules are validation-only declarations. Concrete evaluation skips them.

`axiom` registers trusted output proofs. Its input contract is checked at each rewrite site, but its output contract is assumed rather than validated:

```tersus
axiom positiveMeansOne(x) [{
    affirm x > 0;
}] [{
    affirm x = 1;
}];

x = 5;
rewrite eqToGtZero x;
rewrite positiveMeansOne x;
affirm x = 1;
```

`proof` has the same input/output contract shape, but the body must validate when the rule is defined. Only validated exported output proofs are made available to callers:

```tersus
proof keepPositive(x) [{
    affirm x > 0;
}] [{
    affirm x > 0;
}] {
    affirm x > 0;
};

x = 5;
rewrite eqToGtZero x;
rewrite keepPositive x;
affirm x > 0;
```

Rule names share one validation rule namespace. Defining the same name twice fails validation. Rule bodies contain validation statements only.

## Function Contracts

Function definitions can include validation contract sections between the argument list and body:

```tersus
fn name(arg1, arg2) [{ input validation }] [{ output validation }] {
    body
};
```

Both contract sections are optional. If one contract section is present, it is treated as the input contract. To specify only an output contract, write an empty input contract first:

```tersus
fn add1(i) [{}] [{
    affirm return = (i + 1);
}] {
    return i + 1;
};
```

Input contracts are checked at call sites before the function body's exported proofs are instantiated. They are also assumed while validating the function body.

Output contracts are validated after the body has been validated. Proofs involving argument names, `return`, and proof variables defined in the input or output contract can be exported to callers.

Example:

```tersus
fn getFirstWithSize(lst) [{
    define s = size(lst);
    rewrite eqToGtZero s;
    affirm s > 0;
}] [{
    affirm s > 0;
}] {
    return first(lst);
};

x = [3, 6, 9, 12];
y = getFirstWithSize(x);
affirm y = 3;
affirm s > 0;
```

## Current Limitations

- No `if`, `else`, `while`, or general control flow yet.
- No declarations separate from assignment.
- No strings, floats, records, or generic lists.
- No block comments; only `//` line comments.
- Function calls do not capture lexical closures; function bodies are evaluated with argument bindings plus the standard library context.
- The CLI currently parses input and prints the AST. Evaluation and validation are exercised through the Haskell API and tests.
